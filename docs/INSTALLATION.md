# Installation

You can install Lean by following the [installation instructions][install] on the official website.

The recommended way to install Lean is through **Visual Studio Code** and the **Lean 4 VS Code** extension.
This extension automatically installs all required dependencies.
It also includes syntax highlighting, code completion, version management, links to learning resources and documentation, and many other useful tools.

There are also alternative methods for [manual installation][manual-install], with support for some other editors.

You can also try out the language on the official [web playground][playground] without installing anything.
