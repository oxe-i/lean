# Learning

Lean is both a functional general-purpose programming language and a proof assistant.
There are numerous resources available for learning Lean, some focusing on its programming aspects and others on its use as a theorem prover.

The book [Functional Programming in Lean][functional-programming] is an introduction to the functional programming paradigm using Lean.
It is aimed at programmers who want to learn Lean, even if they have no prior experience with functional programming languages.

For a more in-depth look at theorem proving in Lean, the book [Theorem Proving in Lean 4][theorem-proving] is listed as an official resource.

[The Lean Language Reference][lean-reference] is the authoritative source for detailed information about the language.

Many additional resources for learning Lean are made available by the community in [this repository][community-resources].
