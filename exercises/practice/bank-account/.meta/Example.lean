  The main primitive for synchronization between threads is Std.BaseMutex.
  It is basically C++'s std::mutex.

  There is a higher-level version called Std.Mutex, which is a wrapper around a IO.Ref with a lock.

  In many situations, a IO.Ref may also be used without a mutex.
  The API for IO.Ref guarantees that some operations are atomic, using CAS over the pointer to the value.
  Examples of atomic ops include swap, modify and modifyGet, but _not_ get and set.

  The implementation below uses IO.Ref and atomic operations.
