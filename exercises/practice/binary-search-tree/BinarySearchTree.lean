namespace BinarySearchTree

/-
  You should define a data structure to represent your Binary Search Tree.
  It must be accessed through .data!, .left! and .right!.

  There should also have:

  1. a function buildTree that takes a List of elements and returns your Binary Search Tree with those elements in the correct place.
  2. a .sort, which returns a sorted list of the items in your Tree.
