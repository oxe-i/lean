# How to contribute to the Exercism Lean track

## Contributing

We 💙 our community, but **this repository does not accept unsolicited pull requests at this time**.

Please read this [community blog post][guidelines] for details.

### How to contribute

1. Open a topic on the [Lean forum][lean-forum]
2. Discuss the proposal with the maintainers
3. After receiving the go-ahead, submit a pull request

Pull requests must follow [Exercism's style guide][style].

Before submitting, please read:

- [Contributors Pull Request Guide][contributors-pr-guide]
- [Pull Request Guide][pr-guide]

When opening a PR:

- Clearly describe the problem and the solution
- Link to the corresponding forum discussion
- Add a link to the PR in that same discussion

If the PR touches an existing exercise, please also consider [this warning][unnecessary-test-runs].

### Adding an exercise

Practice exercises should follow the [Add a Practice Exercise docs][add-exercise].

All exercises must include a test generator located in:

```text
generator/Generator/Generator
```

The generator must:

- be imported by `generator/Generator/Generator.lean`
- define the required generator functions
- register them in the `dispatch` table

The Lean track provides a generator script to help with this process.

See the [generator documentation][generator-doc].
